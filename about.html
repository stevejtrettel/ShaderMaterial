<h1>About This Example: Flat Tori in 4-Dimensions</h1>
<p> The Hopf map (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration">Wikipdeia</a>) is a function
    from the 3-dimensional sphere (the surface of the 4-dimensional ball, cut
    out by the equation x2+y2+z2+w2=1 in 4-dimensional space) to the 2-dimensional sphere (the familiar
    sphere in 3-dimensional space).  This map collapses one dimension, and sends an entire circle of points
    in S3 to each point of S2 - making a common way to visualize this as a fibration of S3 by circles.
    This Hopf fibration shows up all over in mathematics, to learn more see these wonderful notes by Zachary Treisman, written for a
    high school mathematics summer program.
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1205.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1205.pdf</a>.

    This example visualizes the work of Ulrich Pinkall, who used the Hopf map to construct an embedding
    of each Euclidean structure on the torus into S3.  Pinkall's paper describing the construction is available
    here:  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234368025_Hopf_tori_in_S3">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234368025_Hopf_tori_in_S3</a>.
    Just as a cylinder can be made in 3-dimensional space by rolling up a sheet of paper without tearing or stretching,
    tori which are isometric to the flat plane can be made in 4-dimensions.
    (This is not possible in 3D, as is easy to believe experimentally: roll a sheet of paper into a cylinder
    and then try to bend it into a torus without crinkling!).
    In fact, abstractly there is a 2-parameter family of distinct ways to roll a plane into a torus, and Pinkall
    showed that all such ways can actually be achieved in R4, by drawing a cricle on the 2-sphere and taking
    its preimage under the Hopf map.
</p>
<p>This program excecutes this construction: starting with a family of curves on the 2-sphere (the family chosen
    is rather arbitrary for now)
    it draws the corresponding flat torus as the preimage under the Hopf map in the 3-sphere.

</p>

<h2>Main Controls</h2>
<p>The main controls concern the choice of initial curve on the 2-sphere.  This curve lies in a family given
    in spherical coordinates by φ(θ)=1+a*(1+0.3sin(t))*sin(n*θ+0.3*(1+cos(t))) with t being time.
<ul>

    <li><strong>Amplitude:</strong>
        This slider determines a in the formula above.</li>

    <li><strong>Folds:</strong> This slider determines n in the formula.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Shading Controls</h2>
<p> These controls allow you to adjust coloring of the surface.
<ul>

    <li><strong>Grid</strong>
        Determines the thickness of grid lines drawn on the torus surface.  With respect to a pair of orthogonal
        circles in S3, there are two associated hopf fibrations (related to left and right quaternion multiplication).
        These grid lines are with respect to the complementary hopf fibration which is used to take the preimage.</li>

    <li><strong>Hue</strong> This determines if the surface is colored by hue (mapped to θ on the 2-sphere) or monochromatically.</li>

    <li><strong>Transmission</strong>Determines the opacity of the surface by setting the fraction of light which transmits through.</li>
</ul>



<h2>View Controls</h2>
<p> The coordinates of S3 are inherited from (x,y,u,v) on R4.  The default projection is stereographic projection from the point v=1.
    These controls determine the projection of R4 to R3 for viewing.


<ul>

    <li><strong>rotx,roty,rotu:</strong>
        Real values from 0 to 1, determining the fraction of Pi in which to rotate the x,y, or u axis into the v axis
        (where the default projection occurs) respectively.
        Setting any given parameter to 1 and leaving the others at 0 will stereographically project from that axis instead.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Tumble:</strong>This animates a path of rotations in SO(4) varying the projection axis, and controls the speed.</li>

    <li><strong>Proj:</strong> This allows you to change the projection type: from stereographic to perspective in R4, to orthographic.</li>
</ul>
